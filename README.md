##  Team Collaboration

- We collaborated using **GitHub** with feature branches and pull requests to review and merge code.
- Each member worked on different modules â€” frontend, backend, and scheduling API.
- The README and documentation were written collaboratively, with assigned sections to avoid conflicts.
- We communicated per week to coordinate work and resolve merge conflicts efficiently.
- This workflow helped maintain code quality and project transparency.
